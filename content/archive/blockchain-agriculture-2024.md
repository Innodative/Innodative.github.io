## The Evolution of Blockchain Technology

"To be blunt, the reason you're not hearing about blockchain as much is that AI has sucked the oxygen out of the room." - Robert Brunner

Machine learning and generative AI have become the tech darlings for 2023 and into 2024. However, blockchain solutions are still here and still showing great potential, Brunner says. In fact, he predicts we'll start hearing more and more about them later this year.

## Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Market Impact

Since Bitcoin drives the rest of the cryptocurrency market, that's a definite driver. "There will be more and more interest in cryptocurrencies and technology that powers the blockchain," says Brunner. "We've already seen interest in optimizing supply chains, tracking and tracing food, verifying genetically modified varieties and identifying pesticide use."

## Blockchain in Agriculture

ISA Director of Market Development Todd Main agrees. "The biggest thing for agriculture is point of origin tracking all the way through the supply chain," he says. "That's valuable in food, in pharmaceuticals. When consumers really start to demand it, that's when we'll see the development ramp up."

In the post-Covid era, we've already seen an influx of major players beta testing blockchain. Nestle announced a Rainforest Alliance-certified blend of coffee beans from three origins, saying consumers would be able to trace the coffee to its origin of Brazil, Colombia and Rwanda.

One project on mangoes reduced tracking time from their origin from seven days to just 2.2 seconds. Today, the retailer is integrating blockchain with AI to enhance procurement and supply chain management, according to The Supply Chain Report in January 2024.

## Key Industry Developments

Meanwhile, Covantis, the blockchain initiative founded by Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus, announced global expansion plans in March 2024, with a new presence across Australian, European and South African grains and oilseeds and the global vegetable oils market. The company says it has cultivated a network of 44 agricultural groups and over 200 legal entities.

Walmart, one of the early adopters of blockchain technology, continues to leverage it for traceability, for example in outbreaks of food-borne disease and in logistics tracking.

## Technical Improvements

Looking ahead, agriculture has much to gain from leveraging blockchain, says Brunner. "Today, Bitcoin can process roughly five transactions a second. For comparison, VISA does around 100,000 in a second," he says. "But there have been developments on how we do process transactions faster with other blockchains, and that will change everything."

Another key development effort is in the core of blockchain. "By its nature, blockchain is entirely public, which may not thrill some people," he explains. "But zero-knowledge proofs would allow you to verify knowledge of something but not make it public."

## AI and Blockchain Integration

And AI and blockchain together provide another avenue for agriculture to leverage the new technology. "Blockchain provides a way for these AI agents to transmit," Brunner explains. "An AI agent could be invoked to act when the weather gets bad, knowing that it needs to sell something automatically or rebalance hedging."

## Looking Forward

Says Main: "Blockchain has a role. It's on the horizon, and we continue to monitor its status, any legislative developments and certainly its potential."

### What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a network of blocks of data that makes information and currency and other data available worldwide. Each digital block contains a set of transactions that are linked together chronologically to form a chain.
