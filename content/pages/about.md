{% newthought "I'm a futurist" %}, technologist, and educator who helps organizations navigate the intersection of emerging technologies and business transformation.

## Background

I'm currently Chief Disruption Officer and Professor of Accountancy at the Gies College of Business, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I also serve as Arthur Andersen Fellow. I'm also Founder and Principal of Innodative, a leading technology consultancy. My somewhat unconventional path—from astrophysics to data science to business education—reflects a consistent focus on extracting insights from complex systems and translating technical capabilities into practical applications.

My work focuses on emerging technologies and how they are impacting business and society, with particular emphasis on artificial intelligence, data science, and their applications to accounting and finance. I enjoy bringing these insights into the classroom, where I work with both undergraduate and graduate students to explore how technology is reshaping the business landscape. I bring an interdisciplinary perspective shaped by a Ph.D. in Astrophysics from Johns Hopkins and postgraduate work at the California Institute of Technology, followed by two decades applying computational methods to complex systems—from cosmological datasets to financial markets.

I am Founder and Principal of Innodative, a technology consultancy that helps organizations navigate digital transformation and leverage emerging technologies for strategic advantage. Through Innodative, I work with businesses to develop AI strategies, implement data science solutions, and build capabilities in emerging technologies.

## Career Trajectory

My career has evolved from cosmological data analysis to building technology-driven business education:

**Business & Analytics Leadership (2017-Present)**  
Transformed business education through strategic technology integration and innovation programs. As Associate Dean for Innovation (2019-2025), founded the Disruption Lab, established the Data Science Research Service, and directed the UI-Deloitte Foundation Center for Business Analytics following a \$5 million pledge. Supervised major entrepreneurship initiatives including the iVenture Accelerator (supporting 100+ ventures that raised \$160M+ and created 1,000+ jobs), experiential learning programs serving 150+ corporate clients annually, and interdisciplinary technology programs. Pioneered AI-driven instruction by creating multilingual avatar-based course delivery and developed multiple Coursera MOOCs reaching global audiences.

**Data Science Pioneer (2014-2017)**  
Led the Illinois Data Science Initiative, bringing together 40+ faculty and staff from twelve colleges to institutionalize data science education and research across campus.

**Astrophysics Research (1997-2017)**  
Twenty years developing and applying machine learning and statistical methods to massive astronomical datasets. Co-founded the Dark Energy Survey and pioneered GPU applications in cosmology.{% sidenote "sn-acm" "Received the 2021 ACM SIGMOD Systems Award for contributions to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey—one of the most prestigious recognitions in database systems." %} Mentored over 100 students who went on to careers at Google, NASA, national labs, and leading universities.

## Beyond Work

When not working with organizations or mentoring students, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading widely across disciplines, and spending time with family.
