{% newthought "I teach" %} courses that bridge technology, data science, and business applications. My focus is helping students understand not just the technical mechanics of emerging technologies, but their strategic implications for business and society.

## Teaching Approach

I bring an interdisciplinary perspective to the classroom, connecting insights from astrophysics, data science, and business analytics. Whether working with undergraduates or graduate students, I emphasize building intuition through hands-on experience with real-world problems.{% sidenote "sn-teaching" "Multiple-time recipient of the 'Incomplete List of Teachers Rated as Excellent by Their Students' award." %}

My courses explore how artificial intelligence, machine learning, and distributed technologies are reshaping business—from financial reporting to strategic decision-making. I pioneered AI-driven instruction by creating multilingual avatar-based course delivery.

## Course Materials & Open Educational Resources

I believe in open education and making high-quality course materials freely available:

**UI-Deloitte Foundation Center for Business Analytics**  
As founding director, published entire courses through the center, with materials receiving over 1,000 downloads from six continents.{% sidenote "sn-deloitte" "The [UI-Deloitte Foundation Center for Business Analytics](https://www.centerforanalytics.giesbusiness.illinois.edu/) provides free online data analytics curriculum to advance business education worldwide." %}

**Software Carpentry Curricula**  
Developed:
- [SQL for Business](https://github.com/ProfessorBrunner/sql-business){% sidenote "sn-sql" "Practical SQL instruction focused on business analytics applications." %}
- [Python for Business](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/python-business){% sidenote "sn-python" "Python programming with emphasis on data analysis for business contexts." %}

**GitHub Course Repositories**  
Maintain open-source course materials covering data science, machine learning, and business analytics.{% sidenote "sn-github" "Course materials available through [github.com/lcdm-uiuc](https://github.com/lcdm-uiuc) and [github.com/ProfessorBrunner](https://github.com/ProfessorBrunner)" %}

## Research on Data Science Education

**Teaching Data Science**  
Brunner, R. J., & Kim, E. J. (2016).  
*Procedia Computer Science*, 80, 1947-1956.  
[Paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2016.05.513) | [arXiv:1604.07397](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07397)

Describes our approach to teaching introductory data science with no prerequisites, covering topics from data storage and visualization to probability, statistics, and high-performance computing using Python.
