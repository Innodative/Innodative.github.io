Explores how time series parameters—sampling frequency, sample period, and series length—affect recovery of industry classifications in financial networks. Using high-frequency S&P 500 data (2005-2012) with normalized mutual information and Planar Maximally Filtered Graphs, applies Leiden and spectral clustering to identify stock communities. Finds optimal industry structure recovery at 4-48 minute sampling frequencies, with clustering accuracy improving during volatile periods like the 2008 financial crisis.
