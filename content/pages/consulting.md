{% newthought "Through Innodative" %}, I help organizations navigate the intersection of emerging technologies and business strategy, with particular focus on artificial intelligence, blockchain, and digital transformation.

## Advisory Philosophy

Effective technology consulting begins with business problems, not technology solutions. The question isn't whether to adopt AI or blockchain—it's what specific problems these tools might solve, and whether the solutions justify the costs and risks.{% marginnote "mn-philosophy" "Technology adoption decisions should be driven by strategic objectives, not fear of missing out." %}

This problem-first approach avoids technology for its own sake and produces more durable recommendations anchored in business value rather than technical trends.

## Areas of Focus

**AI Strategy and Governance**  
Developing coherent approaches to artificial intelligence, including use case identification, risk assessment, vendor evaluation, and policy development.

**Blockchain Feasibility Assessment**  
Evaluating whether distributed ledger technology genuinely fits a business need. Many proposed blockchain applications would work better with traditional databases.{% sidenote "sn-blockchain" "Studies suggest fewer than 10% of announced enterprise blockchain projects have moved to production deployment." %}

**Digital Transformation Roadmapping**  
Examining how technology investments should sequence over time to maximize value while managing implementation risk.

**Financial Reporting and Audit Technology**  
Advising accounting firms and corporate finance teams on AI, automation, and emerging technologies for financial reporting, audit, and assurance services.

## Engagement Approach

Typical engagements follow a structured process: **Discovery** surfaces the organization's current state and constraints through interviews and stakeholder workshops. **Analysis** translates findings into specific, prioritized recommendations. **Roadmap Development** sequences recommendations into an actionable plan with resources, timelines, and metrics. **Implementation Support** provides ongoing guidance during execution.

Consulting relationships work best through genuine partnership—external advisors bring perspective and specialized expertise, while internal teams bring organizational knowledge and execution capability.
