Summary: A practical examination of how accounting firms are deploying LLMs to enhance audit efficiency while maintaining quality standards.

<span class="newthought">The audit profession</span> faces a fundamental tension: the demand for thorough examination of increasingly complex financial statements against the economic pressure to perform this work efficiently. Large language models offer a potential resolution—but only if deployed thoughtfully.

## The Current State of Audit

Modern audits already rely heavily on technology. Data analytics identify anomalies in transaction populations. Automated controls testing verifies that systems operate as designed. But much audit work remains stubbornly manual: reading contracts, evaluating disclosures, assessing management's judgments.

<span class="marginnote">The Big Four accounting firms have each invested hundreds of millions in AI capabilities over the past five years.</span>

These manual tasks are precisely where LLMs show promise. They can process natural language documents at scale, identify relevant provisions in contracts, and flag inconsistencies between different disclosures—all capabilities that align well with traditional audit procedures.

## Practical Applications

Several use cases have moved beyond experimentation into production deployment:

**Contract analysis** represents perhaps the most mature application. LLMs can extract key terms from lease agreements, vendor contracts, and debt instruments, then cross-reference these against recorded accounting entries. What once required hours of manual review can be completed in minutes.

**Disclosure comparison** leverages LLMs' ability to identify semantic similarities and differences. Comparing current-year disclosures against prior periods, peer companies, or regulatory requirements becomes far more systematic.

<span class="sidenote">Early studies suggest LLM-assisted contract review catches 15-20% more relevant provisions than traditional keyword searches.</span>

**Memo drafting** allows auditors to focus on judgment while the model handles initial documentation. The human auditor reviews, refines, and takes responsibility for the final product, but spends less time on first drafts.

## Quality Considerations

These applications raise legitimate quality questions. LLMs can hallucinate, confidently stating things that aren't true. They may miss context that a human auditor would catch. Their training data may not include the most recent accounting standards.

Successful deployments address these concerns through careful workflow design:

- Human review remains mandatory for all LLM outputs
- Models are fine-tuned on domain-specific content
- Outputs include citations to source documents for verification
- Regular testing monitors for degradation or drift

## Regulatory Perspectives

Regulators have approached AI in audit with cautious interest. The PCAOB has indicated that firms remain responsible for work quality regardless of the tools employed. This puts the burden on audit teams to demonstrate that LLM-assisted procedures meet professional standards.

## Looking Forward

The firms currently deploying these tools report efficiency gains of 20-40% on applicable procedures. As models improve and workflows mature, these gains will likely increase. The audit of the future will look quite different from today's—more efficient, more comprehensive, and still fundamentally dependent on professional judgment.
