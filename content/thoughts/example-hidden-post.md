Title: Example Hidden Post
Date: 2024-12-03
Tags: meta
Topic: thoughts
Status: hidden

{% newthought "This post" %} won't appear on the site because it has `Status: hidden` in the metadata.

This is useful for:
- Posts you're working on but aren't ready to publish
- Old content you want to archive without deleting
- Ideas you want to keep in your source but not show publicly

To make this post visible, simply remove the `Status: hidden` line from the metadata and rebuild the site.
