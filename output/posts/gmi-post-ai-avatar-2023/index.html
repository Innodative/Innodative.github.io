<p>What if you could create a realistic-looking digital version of yourself that can clearly explain complex systems and confidently deliver lectures or keynote speeches? Prof. Robert Brunner, an expert in emerging technologies at the Gies College of Business at the University of Illinois, employed artificial intelligence (AI) tools to achieve just that. In fact, Brunner's AI clone is ready to deliver another lecture in March 2024 in front of MBA students.</p>
<h2 id="a-digital-avatar-is-simply-a-culmination-of-ai-tools">A Digital Avatar is Simply a Culmination of AI Tools</h2>
<p>Brunner was able to create a virtual version of himself that looks and sounds just like him. He used a variety of AI tools to accomplish this feat, combining text generation, voice synthesis, and video avatar technology.</p>
<p>Mastering generative AI prompts is the key to a successful digital avatar. Brunner found that once he became good at giving precise prompts to these tools, he was then able to generate a flawless five-minute lecture presented by his digital avatar in just five to 10 minutes. </p>
<p>Also, his AI version boasts multilingual capabilities, even though Brunner knows only English. "It took only a couple of minutes for it to have me speaking Spanish. My virtual clone can also deliver lectures in French and Mandarin," he told Poets and Quants.</p>
<h2 id="the-process-from-script-to-avatar">The Process: From Script to Avatar</h2>
<p>Brunner initially planned to record his video in person but soon realized the challenge of figuring out what to say. He then turned to ChatGPT for help in creating scripts, gradually refining the prompts until the AI tool was able to write scripts in his tone of voice.</p>
<p>"The draft script was created by ChatGPT. I thought what if I build a relationship with ChatGPT so it knows me and the course?" Brunner explained.</p>
<p>This innovative approach to teaching demonstrates the practical applications of AI in education, showing how technology can enhance rather than replace human instructors. The digital avatar allows Brunner to scale his teaching, translate content into multiple languages, and maintain consistency across lectures while freeing up time for more personalized interactions with students.</p>
