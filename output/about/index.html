    <h1>About</h1>
    
    <section>
        <p><span class="newthought">I'm a futurist</span>, technologist, and educator who helps organizations navigate the intersection of emerging technologies and business transformation.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I'm currently Chief Disruption Officer and Professor of Accountancy at the Gies College of Business, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I also serve as Arthur Andersen Fellow. I'm also Founder and Principal of Innodative, a leading technology consultancy. My somewhat unconventional path—from astrophysics to data science to business education—reflects a consistent focus on extracting insights from complex systems and translating technical capabilities into practical applications.</p>
<p>My work focuses on emerging technologies and how they are impacting business and society, with particular emphasis on artificial intelligence, data science, and their applications to accounting and finance. I enjoy bringing these insights into the classroom, where I work with both undergraduate and graduate students to explore how technology is reshaping the business landscape. I bring an interdisciplinary perspective shaped by a Ph.D. in Astrophysics from Johns Hopkins and postgraduate work at the California Institute of Technology, followed by two decades applying computational methods to complex systems—from cosmological datasets to financial markets.</p>
<p>I am Founder and Principal of Innodative, a technology consultancy that helps organizations navigate digital transformation and leverage emerging technologies for strategic advantage. Through Innodative, I work with businesses to develop AI strategies, implement data science solutions, and build capabilities in emerging technologies.</p>
<h2 id="career-trajectory">Career Trajectory</h2>
<p>My career has evolved from cosmological data analysis to building technology-driven business education:</p>
<p><strong>Business &amp; Analytics Leadership (2017-Present)</strong><br>
Transformed business education through strategic technology integration and innovation programs. As Associate Dean for Innovation (2019-2025), founded the Disruption Lab, established the Data Science Research Service, and directed the UI-Deloitte Foundation Center for Business Analytics following a \$5 million pledge. Supervised major entrepreneurship initiatives including the iVenture Accelerator (supporting 100+ ventures that raised \$160M+ and created 1,000+ jobs), experiential learning programs serving 150+ corporate clients annually, and interdisciplinary technology programs. Pioneered AI-driven instruction by creating multilingual avatar-based course delivery and developed multiple Coursera MOOCs reaching global audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Data Science Pioneer (2014-2017)</strong><br>
Led the Illinois Data Science Initiative, bringing together 40+ faculty and staff from twelve colleges to institutionalize data science education and research across campus.</p>
<p><strong>Astrophysics Research (1997-2017)</strong><br>
Twenty years developing and applying machine learning and statistical methods to massive astronomical datasets. Co-founded the Dark Energy Survey and pioneered GPU applications in cosmology.<label for="sn-acm" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-acm" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Received the 2021 ACM SIGMOD Systems Award for contributions to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey—one of the most prestigious recognitions in database systems.</span> Mentored over 100 students who went on to careers at Google, NASA, national labs, and leading universities.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-work">Beyond Work</h2>
<p>When not working with organizations or mentoring students, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading widely across disciplines, and spending time with family.</p>
